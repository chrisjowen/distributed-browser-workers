Use the browser as a distributed worker :)
-------------------------------------------

This is just a hacky play project to see if I could use socket.io to push jobs to various browsers to independently process some work.

Running it
----------------------

- npm install & bower install
- grunt

Starting a worker
- visit: http://localhost:9000. Here you can kick off a task that will queue up another 100 tasks (1 per second) to add 2 numbers together

Monitoring
- visit: http://localhost:9000/monitor.html. See whats happening :)
